The current repository provides access to some examples/tutorials (in English and/or French) that can be used as pedagogical tools to promote bioinformatics/biostatistics analysis.

This directory is subdivided into several sections (folders) reflecting some of the main themes of our study. These sections are organized as follows:
  - **AMR Tools** (folder containing information on tools used for antimicrobial resistance detection)
  - **Bash** (folder containing information on Linux/Unix command lines)
  - **BLAST** (folder containing BLAST software usage examples)
  - **Conda** (folder containing Conda/Bioconda usage example)
  - **Docker** (folder containing information on using Docker)
  - **Galaxy_Wrapper** (folder containing information on setting up a tool on Galaxy)
  - **Metagenomics** (folder containing examples of tools and pipelines for metagenomics analyses)
  - **Nanopore_sequencing** (folder containing examples of tools used for Nanopore sequencing, in particular MinION)
  - **Other_examples** (examples for specific bioinformatics analyses such as bacterial genomics, etc.)
  - **Phylogeny** (examples to perform some phylogenetic/phylogenomic analyses)
  - **SLURM** (folder containing information on using SLURM)
  - **Virtual_Machine** (folder containing information on setting up a virtual machine)

# Metagenomics analyses
Metagenomics analyses are usually performed following two approaches: 
- sequencing of one or more specific genes, called a barcode, common to several species. This is known as targeted metagenomics or metabarcoding 
- sequencing the genomes of organisms present in the environment to be analyzed, regardless of species (bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc.). This is known as shotgun metagenomics.

## Metabarcoding
Metabarcoding analyses are now widely used in bioinformatics. Several tools and pipelines can be used to carry out this kind of analysis:
- [SAMBA](https://gitlab.ifremer.fr/bioinfo/workflows/samba)
- [Qiime2](https://qiime2.org/)
- [SHAMAN](https://github.com/aghozlane/shaman)
- [FROGS](http://sepsis-omics.github.io/tutorials/modules/frogs/)

# Nanopore sequencing (MinION)

Nanopore sequencing is a third generation sequencing approach providing long-read sequencing. 
Several tools and help tutorials are available for Nanopore sequencing.

Some details about the sequencing method are available at this [link](https://nanoporetech.com/applications/dna-nanopore-sequencing).

Several software tools have been developed to perform Oxford Nanopre Technologies (ONT) MinION sequencing. A presentation by Yann Reynaud was given in 2019 to explain [Bacterial sequencing on ONT Minion](http://www.pasteur-guadeloupe.fr/pdf/2019_ONT.pdf).

Tools and tutorials can be easily found online, notably from the [ONT GitHub repository](https://github.com/nanoporetech).

Furthermore, examples on using [MinKNOW](https://nanoporetech.com/about-us/news/oxford-nanopore-releases-update-minknowtm-software-accelerate-basecalling-analysis) and [PycoQC](https://github.com/a-slide/pycoQC) are available in the current folder.
Please note that the user manual provided for PycoQC in the current folder is based on our local server at Institut Pasteur de la Guadeloupe. PycoQC can also be used directly from the sequencing_summary file generated by Albacore or Guppy basecaller using [Galaxy](http://calamar.univ-ag.fr/c3i/galaxy_karubionet.html).

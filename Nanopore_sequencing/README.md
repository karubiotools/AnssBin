# Nanopore sequencing (MinION)

Nanopore sequencing is a third generation sequencing approach providing long-read sequencing. 
Several tools and help tutorials are available for Nanopore sequencing.

Some details about the sequencing method are available at this [link](https://nanoporetech.com/applications/dna-nanopore-sequencing).

Several software tools have been developed to perform Oxford Nanopre Technologies (ONT) MinION sequencing. A presentation by Yann Reynaud was done in 2019 to explain [Bacterial sequencing on ONT Minion](http://www.pasteur-guadeloupe.fr/pdf/2019_ONT.pdf).
